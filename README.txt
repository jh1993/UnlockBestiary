PLEASE CHECK THE DISCORD THREAD FOR UPDATE NOTICES, AND RE-DOWNLOAD THE MOD WHENEVER THERE'S AN UPDATE.

To install this mod, click on the green "Code" button on this page, then "Download ZIP". Please rename the "UnlockBestiary-main" folder to "UnlockBestiary" before putting it into your mods folder.

This is a simple mod that changes the bestiary to either unconditionally show all monsters, or only show monsters that you have not yet defeated.

Your actual save file is not impacted. If you disable this mod, your bestiary will go back to what it was before.

By default, this mod unconditionally shows all bestiary entries. To make it only show undefeated monsters, change the value of "INVERT" on the first line of UnlockBestiary.py from 0 to 1.
